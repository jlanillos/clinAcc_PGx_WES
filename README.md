# clinAc_PGx_WES
This repository includes all self-made scripts written in Python to analyze the pharmacogenetic (PGx) germline genetic variation of 5,001 individuals referred for diagnostic Whole Exome Sequencing (WES).

Mainly, it explains how to translate genotyping data (VCF-like format) into PGx alleles and phenotypes depicted by all the CPIC guidelines (https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/)

These scripts are ordered according to different steps in the analysis.
